aw-watcher-macos
================

Watches for the active window in macOS.

To log current window title the teminal needs acces to macOS accessibility API.
This can be enabled in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility, then add the Terminal to this list. If this is not enabled the watcher can only log current application, and not window title.
